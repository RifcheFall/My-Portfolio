        <h3>Project Manager / Scrum Master</h3>
        <p>
          A dedicated Project Manager and Scrum Master with a proven track
          record in driving successful projects and fostering collaborative team
          environments. With a background in Business Management and extensive
          experience in agile methodologies, I am passionate about delivering

          Arts, and Mathematics), continually seeking innovative ways to
          integrate these fields into my work.

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I am Cherif Alwaly Fall, a dedicated and passionate individual who believes in the power of resilience, adaptability, and continuous growth. As a proud graduate of Washburn University in Kansas, where I was a member of the Men's Basketball Team and earned my degree in Business Management, my journey is a reflection of the values and experiences that have shaped me into who I am today. Born and raised in Senegal, West Africa, I embarked on a life-changing adventure in 2012 when I received a scholarship to attend Lee Academy in Maine. This pivotal moment marked the beginning of a transformative chapter in my life, as I courageously stepped out of my comfort zone, leaving behind the familiar sights and sounds of home to embrace a world filled with new challenges and opportunities.
        Navigating this unfamiliar territory, I discovered the true essence of resilience and adaptability. With the unwavering support of my teammates and classmates, I learned the importance of teamwork and collaboration, values that have remained at the core of my personal and professional journey. My academic and athletic pursuits led me to Cloud County Community College in Kansas, where I majored in Business Administration and played an integral role on the Men's Basketball Team. These formative years were instrumental in honing my leadership skills, fostering my passion for personal growth, and deepening my commitment to excellence both on and off the court.

            <h1>My Purpose</h1>
            <p>
                Upon completing my associate degree, I transferred to Washburn University, where I continued my academic journey in Business Management. Despite facing setbacks due to injuries that prematurely ended my basketball career, I embraced these challenges as opportunities for growth and self-discovery, paving the way for new avenues of exploration and development.

                Fueled by a love for learning and a burning desire to make a meaningful impact, I am deeply committed to being a catalyst for positive change, particularly in Africa. Recognizing the power of mentorship and guidance, I have established a nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering and mentoring children, guiding them through their unique journeys, and inspiring them to realize their full potential.
                
                As someone who thrives on challenges and embraces the spirit of continuous learning, I am excited about the future and eager to leverage my skills, experiences, and vision to create meaningful and lasting impact. With a heart full of hope and a mind filled with ambition, I look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead, as I continue to pursue my passion for excellence and strive to be a beacon of inspiration and change in the world.

            In The Heart Of Senegal, Where Warm Sands Blend With The Youthful Love For Sports, A Young Boy Named Cherif Alwaly Fall Grew Up Dreaming Of Basketball. Cherif Also Witnessed The Harsh Realities Faced By Many: The Struggle To Afford Even The Most Necessities, Like Shoes To Play The Game They Loved. These Scenes Left An Unforgettable Marks On Cherif's Soul, Igniting A Fire Within Him To Make A Difference. In 2014, Cherif Turned His Passion Into Action, Founding CAFAll Charity—A Source Of Hope, Dedicated To Uplifting Communities Across Senegal And Beyond. Born From A Desire To Give Back To The Country That Shaped Him, CAFAll Charity Stands As A Testament To Cherif's Commitments To Making A Positive Impact. As Cherif's Journey Carried Him From The Streets Of Senegal To The Basketball Courts Of The United States, His Heart Remained Attached To His Roots. With Every Game Won And Every Hoop Scored, He Felt A Deep Sense Of Responsibility To Those Who Had Supported Him Along The Way. Through CAFAll Charity, Cherif Channels This Gratitude Into Tangible Change, Striving To Create A World Where Every Child Has The Opportunity To Thrive. But CAFAll Charity Is More Than Just A Philanthropic Endeavor—It's A Labor Of Love, Fueled By The Collective Spirit Of Those Who Believe In Cherif's Vision. Together, They Work Tirelessly To Break Down Barriers And Empower The Next Generation Of Leaders, Athletes, And Changemakers.
